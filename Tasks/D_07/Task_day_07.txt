Day 7 Task

Create your own String class. Implement String class similar to the strings in Python and C++. (The way we implemented the List class). 
Overload+ operator to concatenate two string. Overload* operator to multiply string. (Ex: "yash"2 returns "yashyash"). 2"yash" should also return "yashyash". 
Overload the input and output operator. Try to overload as many operators as you can.
