Day 8 Tasks:

Problem statement On Inheritance

I want my Personal data, Professional data, & Academic data to be separated in different classes and 4th class called biodata.
If I create object of biodata class then using that object I can get all my professional, personal and academic data.

Decide which type of inheritance you will be using to achieve this goal .

Take data members in classes as follows:
personal class - Name, Surname, address, mobile_no, dob.
professional class - name_of_organization, job_profile, project.
Academic - year_of_passing, cgpa, college_name, branch

member functions
All class includes default constructor(if data members are present), and one function to get data from user for its data member.

Note :- define all data members as protected so that you can access this members in its derived class directly
